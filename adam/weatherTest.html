Stay in air-conditioned areas, drink plenty of fluids, wear light-coloured, loose-fitting clothing and a wide-brimmed hat, and avoid strenuous activities, especially during the hottest times of the day. If possible, limit time spent outdoors, and seek medical attention if you experience any signs of heat stress, such as nausea, dizziness, or confusion.
